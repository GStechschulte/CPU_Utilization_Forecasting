# CPU_Utilization_Forecasting
Project for Data Analytics for Energy Systems and IoT (DAE01 - H2001)

**Objective**: Forecasting CPU utilization by cores in VM clusters

Why: Computing and information processing capacity for corporations, public organizations, and individuals have been increasing speedily.
Such a vast and vivid increase in the computing resources requires a scalable and efficient information technology (IT) infrastructure including servers,
electrical grids, physical infrastructure, storage, network bandwidth, personnel and huge capital expenditure and operational cost. Cloud data centers 
are the strength of todayâ€™s demanding IT infrastructure and there is crucial need to improve its efficiency.

Problem: Data Centers require substanstial amounts of of power to maintain due to three key reasons - 1.) Server Usage 2.) Cooling Units (CACU/Water Tanks)
3.) Power Conversions

**Deliverable**: The power consumption of processers increases as the number of cores utilized in these processers increase. In this initial modeling phase and in the visualizations, we analyze the running frequency of multicore processors in virtual machines and develop a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree to predict the average running frequency on an hourly basis.
