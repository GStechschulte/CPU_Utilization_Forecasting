# CPU_Utilization_Forecasting
Project for Data Analytics for Energy Systems and IoT (DAE01 - H2001)

Objective: Forecasting future CPU utilization by cores in VM clusters

Why: Computing and information processing capacity for corporations, public organizations, and individuals have been increasing speedily.
Such a vast and vivid increase in the computing resources requires a scalable and efficient information technology (IT) infrastructure including servers,
electrical grids, physical infrastructure, storage, network bandwidth, personnel and huge capital expenditure and operational cost. Cloud data centers 
are the strength of todayâ€™s demanding IT infrastructure, there is crucial need to improve its efficiency.

Problem: Data Centers require substanstial amounts of of power to maintain due to three key resons - 1.) Server Usage 2.) Cooling Units (CACU/Water Tanks)
3.) Power Conversions

Hypothesis: Due to the linear effect of energy consumption and utilized number of CPU cores, if we can accurately forecast CPU utilization by cores, 
then it is possible to increase energy efficiency through several ways.
